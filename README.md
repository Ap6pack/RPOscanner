*Relative Path Overwrite Vulnerability Scanner* - Version 1

## Ever heard about **RPO Attack**?

If not here is the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrHkG5choM4) about "Relative Path Overwrite (RPO) Attack". It's a lesser-known web-based vulnerability yet a very cool vulnerability. File descriptor was rewarded with 6000$ for his sweet exploit on this from Google. I have explained about this attack along with the mitigation techniques in our own language (**NEPALI**).  It might be fruitful for not only security enthusiastic but also for developers.
